# Elastic Map Reduce

AWS [EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/) is a managed Hadoop service that makes it easy to process vast amounts of data
across dynamically scalable Amazon EC2 instances. You can also run other popular distributed frameworks such
as [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and [Presto](https://prestodb.io/) in EMR, and interact with data in other
AWS data stores such as [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).

Follow the [Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-gs.html) guide to create an EMR
Cluster and submit a Spark job.
